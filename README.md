C25K-timer
==========

A simple Couch to 5k timer, in HTML5/Javascript 

Couch to 5k is a program that gets people up and running a 5k in a
couple months by doing intervals of running and walking, gradually
increasing the running and decreasing the walking. A disconnected
timer is helpful. 

This has been tested on an iPod Touch running IOS 6. Load the page
(http://wiredfool.github.io/C25K-timer/) in Safari, save it to the
home screen, and it should be available for offline usage.
